Essence of DP ---> Those who don't remember their past are condemned to repeat it.

1) First we solve a problem using recursion  but the time complexity is exponential .
2) To deal with it we introduce a term called memoisation(memo) where we create an array or vector to store the values of already computed that are
   going to get used in further recursive calls .
3) This is what generally known as DP ( a top-down approach )
4) Further optimising it --> we call it tabulation method where we try to convert the recursive technique into an iterative technique .
5) Both of them will reduce the time complexity from exponential to linear .
6) In additon to that , we can further optimise the space complexity in some problems (not all) from O(n) to O(1) . Basically we just try to not to use arrays
  or vector , instead of them only use variables .


Note:-This is basically what DP is , technique of optimisation is simple , what challenges you is thinking the logic for recursion .
